## Code contributions

### 1. Install requirements

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure that you add it to PATH!)
2. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
3. Clone repository
4. Open a terminal in the cloned repository folder
5. Run the following command to init your local environment and to install all dependencies
   `uv sync`

### 2. Execute from source

1. Open a terminal in the root folder of this repo
2. Execute main file with uv
   `uv run src\main.py`

### 3. Compile and build executable

1. Run `build.bat` from the root folder of this repo.
2. The executable and all dependencies are built in the `dist/MMM`-Folder and get packed in a `dist/Mod Manager Migrator v[version].zip`.

## Translations

Make sure to follow the steps under [Code contributions](#code-contributions) above to install all requirements, including the Qt tools to translate this app.

1. To generate a translation file for a new language, copy the following line in [update_lupdate_file.bat](./update_lupdate_file.bat):
`--add-translation=res/loc/de.ts ^`, insert it directly beneath it and change the `de` value to the short code of your language.
For example, to generate a file for French, the new line would look like this: `--add-translation=res/loc/fr.ts ^`
2. Run `update_lupdate_file.bat && update_qts.bat` to generate the translation file for your language.
3. Open the translation file in Qt Linguist with `uv run pyside6-linguist res/loc/<language>.ts`, eg. `uv run pyside6-linguist res/loc/fr.ts`.
4. Translate MMM and save the file with Ctrl+S.
5. For your language to show up in MMM's settings: add a line, similar to the existing languages, under `class Language(BaseEnum):` in [localisation.py](./src/core/utilities/localisation.py). For example, for French: `French = "fr_FR"`.
6. Optional: Run `compile_qts.bat && uv run src\main.py` and change the language in *Settings* to your translation (and restart) to see your translation in action.
7. Create a pull request from your changes and I will check over it and merge it if there are no issues with it.
